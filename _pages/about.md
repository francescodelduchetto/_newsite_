I am a Lecturer (Asst. Prof.) in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems</a> at the University of Lincoln UK.

*update* >
The goal of my research is to make robots being able to <bold>learn from the human feedback</bold> to <bold>adapt their behaviour</bold> and <bold>improve their autonomy while acting in the real world</bold>. 
I also spend time doing <em>Robot Software Engineering</em> so that our <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/projects/lindsey-a-robot-tour-guide/">tour guide robot</a> can safely and reliably be between humans.

I was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate working with <a href="https://marisegalveztrigo.com/">Ms. Maria Jose Galvez Trigo</a> in the <a href=https://www.tas.ac.uk/research-projects-2022-23/tarics>TARICS project</a>, and a PhD student advised by Prof. Marc Hanheide in the <a href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/projects/lindsey-a-robot-tour-guide/">Lindsey, the tour guide robot" project</a>. I graduated from Sapienza University of Rome with a MSc in “Artificial Intelligence and Robotics” advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/iocchi/home">Prof. Luca Iocchi</a> and from the University of Bologna with a BSc in “Computer Science and Engineering” advised by <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/andrea.roli/en">Prof. Andrea Roli</a>.
